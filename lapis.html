<h4>biography</h4>
<p>Lapis lazuli was a character who frequently went through traumatic instances like being imprisoned 2 times for example one instance was when she was caught in a war and put in a sort of mirror that kept her from being realsed and the other instance she willingly imprisoned herself because her soul was tied to someone else who was trying to hurt the one who let her out of her containment after thousands of years so she felt a sense of loyalty to them.</p>
